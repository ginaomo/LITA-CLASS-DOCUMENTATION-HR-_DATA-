## Project

### Project Overview:
---              
The essense of this project is to analyze employee attrition patterns within the organization, focusing on how factors like job title, educational field, gender, age band, and job satisfaction impact turnover. By understanding these relationships, by analysing the various parameters in this data the insight gathered will be aimed to guide strategies for employee retention, satisfaction improvement, and optimized workforce planning.

   1. for data storage
   2. for data cleaning
   3. for ata analysing
   4. for data visualization

  1. for portfolio building

### Data Cleaning and preparation
---
In the initial stage of the data cleaning and preparations; the following are the actions taken;
  -  the data loading and inspection through power query editor- i ensured it was put in transform state.
  -  The data transformation also took place in the table view by creating more insight
  -  ata cleaning and formatting of additional columns and measure within the context of the table.
  -  n-deptt scrutinising of data to ensure they are put in their correct usuable types.

### Exporatory Data Analysis
---
 EDA is used to analyze the data set by answering some questons about the data, such as;
  - The TotaL Nnumber of employees
  - What is the current employees in the company
  - What is the attrition Rate
  - Which department have the highest attrition
  - The percentage attrition rate per department
  - what impact does job satisfaction have on the employee turnover
  - Does Educational field and age band has impact on attrition rate.
  - The impact of Job role on the

### Action point
---
To answer the above questions the following steps were taken:
 - Calculation of attrition Count USING Calculated col Calculation of attrition rate through measure
 - The use of thebelow visualization tools was employed to generate a well organised dashboard for effective analysis:
   1. Tables
   2. Matrix
   3  Column bar chat
   4. Pie chat
   5. Donot
   6. Slicer



### Data Analysis / findings
---
 This is where i included some basic lines of code/ queries or even some of the DAX expression used during analysis;
 In the analysis of the data given the following was found

- The total number of employees is 1470

- Attritions Count  is 237

- Total number of current employees is 1233

- Average age is 37

- Attrition rate is 16%
- Attrition by Age-band
   1. Under 25 total Attrition count is 38 Employees
   2. 25-34 Total attrition count is 112 Employees
   3. 35-44 Total attrition count is 51 Employees
   4. 45-54 Total attrition count is 25 Employees
   5. 55 and above attrition count is 11 Employees
 
   The age band with the highest attrition rate is age-band 25-34
 

### Data Visualization

- Attrition per department
There are three department in organisation whose data is been analysed 
- Research and development (R&D)
- Human Resourses (HR)
- Sales
  
  The visual below explicitely shows the breakdown of the employee turnover in the organistation in relation to department amongst other parameters.
  
  1. R & D has a total of 133 employee involved with 56.12%
  2. HR has 5,06% which is equal to 12 employees
  3. Sales department has 92 employees involved with  38.82%
    among the three Reseach and development contributed 56.12% of attrition ie employee turnover.
     
  The above is the percentage from each department which is summed up to make a Total of the entire 16% total attrition rate  being experience in the company.

The below visualization depicts the Education field with the highest attriction rate in relation to age band and gender

The column chat was us to represent different age group with their total number or employees which slows that the age band between 35-44 have the highest level of employees
this perfect arrange of the age groups was gotten in absending order by creating a condition column as sorting the age  with interesting levels re-arrangement.
the table chat shows the Job roles in which they most dissactisfied which is laboratory scientist followed by reaseach scientist
