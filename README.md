### Data Cleaning and preparation
---
In the initial stage of the data cleaning and preparations; the following are the actions taken;
  -  the data loading and inspection through power query editor- i ensured it was put in transform state.
  -  The data transformation also took place in the table view by creating more insight
  -  ata cleaning and formatting of additional columns and measure within the context of the table.
  -  n-deptt scrutinising of data to ensure they are put in their correct usuable types.
